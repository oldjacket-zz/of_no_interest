###basics 
#getting a type
type()

# Create a variable savings
savings = 100

# Print out savings
print(savings)

# Create a variable savings
savings = 100

# Create a variable factor
factor = 1.1

# Calculate result
result = savings*factor**7. # seven years of interest

# Print out result
print(result)

# Several variables to experiment with
savings = 100
factor = 1.1
desc = "compound interest"

# Assign product of factor and savings to year1
year1 = savings*factor

# Print the type of year1
print(type(year1))

# Assign sum of desc and desc to doubledesc
doubledesc = desc + desc

# Print out doubledesc
print(doubledesc)


###lists 
#lists are represented in brackets [a,b,c]
#can have many data types

# area variables (in square meters)
hall = 11.25
kit = 18.0
liv = 20.0
bed = 10.75
bath = 9.50

# when printed these function sorta like lables.
areas = ["hallway", hall, "kitchen", kit, "living room", liv, "bedroom", bed, "bathroom", bath]

# Print areas
print(areas)

# Print areas
